# SpringBoot Bookstore App

Simple Spring boot app using:

 - H2 DB.
 - Thymeleaf.
 - Spotless.

That creates a DB in H2, stores Authors, Publishers and Books with its respective relationships. It displays the values in a really simple Thymeleaf template.

**Links:**

 - List of authors: http://localhost:8080/authors
 - List of books: http://localhost:8080/books
 - H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
